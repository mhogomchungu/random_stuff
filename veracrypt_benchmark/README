This project tries to find out how long it takes to unlock a VeraCrypt volume.

The project ships with two binaries.

1. cryptsetup_veracrypt.benchmark
	- This binary has a run time dependency on VeraCrypt and a build time dependency on
	  cryptsetup >= 1.7.0. It runs the benchmark on both cryptsetup and VeraCrypt.
	- You need to have cryptsetup >=1.7.0 installed to run this binary.
	- You need to have VeraCrypt installed to run this binary.

2. cryptsetup.benchmark
	- This binary has a run time dependency on VeraCrypt only and it only benchmarks
	  VeraCrypt.
	- cryptsetup is not required.

Source code for the binary programs is in "src" folder.

To run the test that tests for both cryptsetup and VeraCrypt,just run:

./cryptsetup_veracrypt.benchmark

To run the test that tests for only VeraCrypt,just run:

./veracrypt.benchmark

BOTH COMMANDS MUST BE RUN FROM ROOT'S ACCOUNT!!!
